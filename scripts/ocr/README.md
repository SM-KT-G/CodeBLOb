# OCR Examples

This directory hosts small OCR-oriented utilities intended to be easy to read
and adapt. The first script focuses on showing how to combine Pillow and
pytesseract to read text from an image that the script generates on the fly.

## Goals

- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented.
- Provide runnable examples that do not require external assets.
- Explain the moving pieces so the code doubles as a tutorial.
