# Random Tools

This directory hosts small Python snippets that demonstrate practical uses of
the `random` module.

## Goals

- Keep dependencies limited to the standard library.
- Offer easily understandable examples you can drop into other scripts.
- Showcase multiple randomization techniques (integers, selections, passwords).
