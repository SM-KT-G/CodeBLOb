# Random Tools

This directory hosts small Python snippets that demonstrate practical uses of
the `random` module.

## Goals

- Keep dependencies limited to the standard library.
- Offer easily understandable examples you can drop into other scripts.
- Showcase multiple randomization techniques (integers, selections, passwords).

## Usage

The `random_fun.py` script prints several demos in one go:

```bash
python scripts/random_tools/random_fun.py --count 10 --seed 42
```

Output includes random integers with summary stats, random fruit selections, and
a few password samples (limited to three for readability).
